a)A user requests content from www.foobar.com using a browser.

b)The browser then sends http request to the DNS. 

c)The DNS transforms the domain name to the ip address of the server.

d)The server has got several component namely: web server,application server database and codebase.
	i)A web server is a software that handles client/user http requests for static content ie. images,files and videos from a website

	ii)An application server serves business logic(which is dynamic content) to application programs used by clients.

	iii)The codebase refers to the programs and functions that manipulate data

	iv)A database is a colection of related data.

e)The server then provides HTTP response back to the browser to be accessed by user

This type of server is an SPOF server because nothing is redundant.
The website would temporarily be down when new code is deployed, therefore the server needs to be restarted.
This infrastructre is not scallable and hence can't handle traffic exceeding its servers capacity. 
This server is communicating over a network
