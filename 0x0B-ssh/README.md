SSH is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely.
It provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell.
After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote server and executed there.
The most common way of connecting to a remote Linux server is through SSH.
SSH stands for Secure Shell and provides a safe and secure way of executing commands, making changes, and configuring services remotely.
When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account that exists on the remote server.
