# Building regular expression using Oniguruma

## A regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default

For this project I will build Regular expressions with the help of a library called Oniguruma by Ruby.
Some of the problems that I solve include:

*|0-simply_match_expressions| Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
*|1-repetition_token_0.rb| Creating a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
*|2-repetition_token_1.rb| Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
*|3-repetition_token_2.rb| Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
*|4-repetition_token_3.rb| Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method.
*|5-beginning_and_end.rb| The regular expression must be exactly matching a string that starts with h ends with n and can have any single character in between
*|6-phone_number.rb| The regular expression must match a 10 digit phone number
*|7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb| The regular expression must be only matching: capital letters
